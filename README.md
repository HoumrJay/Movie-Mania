# Movie-Mania
<p>Movie Mania is an Android application developed as a student project for the Udacity Android Nanodegree Course. Organized grid layouts in the app provide users with lists of the most popular and top rated movies on <a href="www.themoviedb.com" target="_blank">www.themoviedb.com</a>. A simple click on a movie poster redirect the user to the detail page that contains the title, release date, movie rating, plot, reviews and list of trailers that can the user either watch (simple click) or share (long click).</p>
<p>Another feature on the detail page is heart-shaped favourite button that gives the user possibility to mark a movie as favourite and create a personal library (or database, if you will) of movies which is ascessible offline.</p>
<p>NOTE: In order to run this code you need to register for your own API key here: <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup" target="_blank">Get API key</a>.<br>Once you have the API key you need to put it in "FragmentPopularity.java" and "FragmentRating.java":</p>
